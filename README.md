BitMarket
=========

BitMarket prototype implementation.

Getting Started
---------------

To build BitMarket you will need a Java 7 environment with a working SBT 0.13.

As sbt-axis plugin is not available on maven central you should clone
`git@github.com:sortega/sbt-axis.git` and run `sbt publishLocal` from the downloaded repository.
